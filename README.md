# Project 4 - Going Back to Work

This is a course project from NYU CS-GY 6613 – Artificial Intelligence I. The goal of this project is to get a model of taxi drop offs of selected locations at each hour through out the day, and formulate a policy to flatten the curve of drop offs (reduce population density) in order to protect people from infection。
